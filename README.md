<h1>Get your Strava data in CSV format!</h1>
<p>For now, this is a simple tool to grab activities from the Strava API and write them to a CSV file. This allows the data
to be analyzed in other tools such as Excel without being confined to the summaries and graphs provided by Strava's UI.</p>
<p>A subset of available fields are written to the CSV. Notable exclusions are social metrics number of kudos, comments,
and photo uploads per activity. If I'm more interested in these in the future they're easy to add in.</p>
